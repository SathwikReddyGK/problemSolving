# # Description
# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
# nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

# Solution
# // Time Complexity : O(log(n))
# // Space Complexity : O(1)
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : None


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Approach is to keep searching the higher number, used binary search to find mid, check if mid is greater than its neighbours
# if not then move towards the neighbour who is greater than mid. Perform this recursively to find the solution
