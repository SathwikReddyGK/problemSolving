# Description

# Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

# A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
# Output: 2
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
# Output: 2
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
# -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# -107 <= k <= 107

# Solution

# // Time Complexity : O(nlogn)
# // Space Complexity : O(n)
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : None


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Approach is to sort each string and save original string in dictionary with sorted value as key. This helps us keep all the
# strings which are anagrams under same key in dictionary
