# Problem
# 42. Trapping Rain Water
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
# Example 1:
# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
# Constraints:

# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
# 0 <= height[i] <= 105
# Solution

# // Time Complexity : Approach1 O(N) - Need to check
#                      Approach2 O(N)
#                      Approach3 O(N)
# // Space Complexity : O(1) all approaches
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Approach1 - My own brute force approach is using two pointer approach with some edge cases
# Approach2 - Find the Max first, now come from left by updating the left wall, so that leftwall will be
# max quantity of water and actual will be leftwall subtract current wall height. Keep udpating the leftwall
# if we get higher wall before reaching the maximum. Once left half is done, perform the same from right
# side, considering right wall and travel till max height.
# Approach3 - Same as approach2 but achieving it in one pass, using four pointers, two for left wall and left pointer
# two for right and right pointer
# Approach4 - Monotonic stack, to be implemented
